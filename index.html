        <p> Mission: Impossible is a series of American action spy films based on and a follow-on from the television series of the same name created by Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by and stars Tom Cruise, whose character is Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and scored from various filmmakers and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original series by Lalo Schifrin.

Beginning in 1996, the films (taking place starting six years after the events of the previous TV sequel series) follow the missions of the IMF's main field team under the leadership of Hunt to stop an enemy force all the while preventing an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to the ensemble cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films.

The series has received a positive reception from critics and audiences alike, and is the 16th-highest-grossing film series of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $3.5 billion to date,[1] and is often cited as one of the best action franchises to date. The sixth and most recent film, titled Mission: Impossible â€“ Fallout, was released on July 27, 2018. The seventh and the upcoming film, with the working title Mission: Impossible 7, is scheduled to release on May 27, 2022.

All of the Mission: Impossible films are co-produced and released by Paramount Pictures and are rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association </p>
